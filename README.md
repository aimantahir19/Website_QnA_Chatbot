Q&A App for Your Website
This project is a Streamlit application that leverages the power of LangChain to create a question-answering bot. It retrieves content from a specified URL, splits the content into chunks, embeds it into a vector store, and uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model to answer user questions based on the content of the URL.

Features
Load documents from a URL.
Split documents into manageable chunks for processing.
Embed document chunks into a vector store for similarity searches.
Create a RAG chain to generate answers to user questions based on the document content.
Deploy the application using Streamlit.
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
OpenAI API key
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qa-app.git
cd qa-app
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
